# Tree Graph Fun

Trees, Graphs, and Hierarchy are everywhere in Life. Let's take some time to have fun understanding them and write code to create and use them.

Things to Learn:
- Git/Github, if you are here I hope you are git comfortable, but please use this to get more comfortable with Git (clone, add, commit, push, pull, etc.)
- Classes and Objects (Inheritance)
  - OOP vs Functional, why not both, always!
- Graph Node Edges, Undirected
- TreeGraph, Directed, Parent and Children
- JSON Array/Object compare Python List/Dict
  - forget about Python Tuples and Python Arrays
  
Eventually:
- semi-connected (unilateral) graphs
  - Is that just normal DAGs?
- strong connected graphs
- weak connected graphs
